# = X10 Interface
#
# This is a really simple X10 framework for controlling X10 devices.
#
# == Example:
#
#   require 'x10/cm17a'
#   lamp = X10.device("a1")
#   lamp.on
#   sleep(1)
#   lamp.off
#
# == Controllers and Devices
#
# An X10 controller is responsible for interfacing to the X10
# interface device.  An example is the CM17A firecracker module.
#
# == Default Controllers
#
# blah blah blah.
